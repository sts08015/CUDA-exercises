# CUDA-exercises

This is a repository of codes that I've written to study CUDA programming.

I followed this crash course : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxNPSjHT5qvtYRVdNN1yDcdSl39uHV_sU

I wrote each code slightly differently from the above crash course.

If you are interested in writing CUDA codes, I recommend you to refer to my codes or follow the above amazing crash course.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I'll be so glad to receive such requests :)
